# TODO:
- Look into `rustaceanvim`. It might not be necessary after all. -> seems like rustaceanvim is a better choice
- `rust-analyzer`'s newest version doesn't work with WSL2 Ubuntu-24.04. To revert back to a stable version use `:MasonInstall rust-analyzer@2024-10-21`
- Tried `fidget` but it didn't work
